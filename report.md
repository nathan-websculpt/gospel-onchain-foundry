# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

	```solidity
	    function finalizeBook(bytes memory _bookId) external notFinalized onlyOwner {
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;

- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 4](src/BookManager.sol#L4)

	```solidity
	pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <0.9.0;
	```

</details>



## L-3: Event is missing `indexed` fields

Index event fields make the field more quickly accessible to off-chain tools that parse events. However, note that each index field costs extra gas during emission, so it's not necessarily best to index the maximum allowed per event (three fields). Each event should use three indexed fields if there are three or more fields, and gas usage is not particularly of concern for the events in question. If there are fewer than three fields, all of the fields should be indexed.

	```solidity
	    event Finalization(address indexed finalizedBy, bytes bookId);
	```

</details>



## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-5: Modifiers invoked only once can be shoe-horned into the function



<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 49](src/BookManager.sol#L49)

	```solidity
	    modifier hasNotConfirmed(address addr, uint256 verseId) {
	```

</details>



## L-6: Loop condition contains `state_variable.length` that could be cached outside.

Cache the lengths of storage arrays if they are used and not modified in for loops.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/BookDeployer.sol [Line: 52](src/BookDeployer.sol#L52)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < deployments.length; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-7: Costly operations inside loops.

Invoking `SSTORE`operations in loops may lead to Out-of-gas errors. Use a local variable to hold the loop computation result.

- Found in src/BookManager.sol [Line: 112](src/BookManager.sol#L112)

	```solidity
	        for (uint256 i = 0; i < length; i++) {
	```

</details>



## L-8: State variable could be declared immutable

State variables that are should be declared immutable to save gas. Add the `immutable` attribute to state variables that are only changed in the constructor
